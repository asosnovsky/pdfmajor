"""
Fork of PDFMiner.six using latest python support and a more trim down approach

PDFMajor is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents.
It's main focus is on obtaining as closely related results that reflect the bare-bone structure of the 
pdf document.
It includes a PDF converter that can transform PDF files into other text
formats (such as HTML, XML, JSON). It has an extensible PDF parser that can be used for
other purposes instead of text analysis.
