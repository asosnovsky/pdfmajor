PDF-Major is a fork of `PDFMiner.six`. It is meant to be a more light-weight implementation that makes fewer assumptions on the data. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a simpler, faster and more functional library that both casual and low-level developers could build upon.

## Documentation

See documentation [here](https://asosnovsky.github.io/pdfmajor/).

## Basic Example
```py
from pdfmajor.interpreter import PDFInterpreter

for page in PDFInterpreter("/path/to/pdf.pdf"):
    print("page start", page.page_num)
    for item in page:
        print(" >", item)
    print("page end", page.page_num)
    
```

## Why Another Fork?

`PDFMiner` was designed to run in python 2.7>, `PDFMiner.six` was written to bring cross-version support for python 2 and 3. However, after attempting to build and extend upon `PDFMiner.six` I found it rather difficult to extend and identify additional details regarding the items encoded in the pdf. This library will attempt to expose as much information as possible to end-users, without having them solely rely on to-xml or to-json exports.

## Features

 * Functional extraction method based on generators
 * Parse, analyze, and convert PDF documents.
 * PDF-1.7 specification support. (well, almost)
 * Font-Color extraction
 * Shape fill and stroke color extraction
 * CJK languages and vertical writing scripts support.
 * Various font types (Type1, TrueType, Type3, and CID) support.
 * Basic encryption (RC4) support.

**Note**: We took out the layout-analysis process in this version (there is no more LTTextHorizontal or LTTextVertical). While the mathematics behind the grouping process was sound, the coupling of the layout-analysis process with the parsing and interpretation process produced unfriendly-code. This feature could be brought back by running your own implementation of it on the `pdfmajor.interpreter.PageInterpreter` class, but at the current time is not supported.
